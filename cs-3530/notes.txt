Computation: You can write down the rules.
What do we want in a theory?
	*Precision
	*Mathematical, formal
	*Can prove theorems about computation
	*Generality
	*Technology-independent, applies to the future as well as the present
	*Abstraction: Ignores inessential details
Representing information
	Alphabet
		*A set of chars
	Strings
		*Finite concatenation of alphabet symbols, order matters
		Empty string = e
	Inputs & Outputs
		*Strings

(x . y) . z = x . (y . z)
sigma = 0 = any single letter
Base Case
|z| = 0 => z = empty string = E
(x . y).z = (x.y).E = x.y
x.(y.z) = x.(y.E) = x.y	

Induction Hypothesis
For any x,y and any w s.t. |w|<=n, (x.y).w=x.(y.w)

Induction Step
Let |z|=n+1, then z= w0 for some 0eE and some weE^n
(x.y).z = (x.y).(w0)
        = ((x.y).w)0     by def of concatenation--->
        = (x.(y.w))0     by induction hypothesis
        = x.((y.w)0)     by def of concatenation<---
        = x.(y.(w0))     by def of concatenation<---
        = x.(y.z)        (z = w0)

A Language is a set of strings. finite or infinite. No need for internal structure.

e = the empty string
0/ = the empty set, a language

kleene star 

E* = Kleene Star of E

How to write a good proof
1. State the game plan, including the general proof technique you are using.
2. Keep the flow linear and use English to explain when you are moving step to step.
3. Proofs are read by humans.
4. Use as little new symbols as possible, and use old symbols correctly.
5. Avoid "Clearly"
6. When you are done explain you are done.

a DFA M is a 5-tuple(Q,E,little sigma, q0, F)
Q: Finite of states
E: Alphabet
little sigma: Transition function
q0: Start state
F: Accept or final state

a DFA needs to have a transition coming out of every single node with only one state
Q = {q0,q1,q2,q3,q4,q5}
E = {P,S}
littlesigma = littlesigma|P |S
		       q0|q3|q0
		       q1|q4|q1
		       q2|q5|q2
		       q3|q0|q4
		       q4|q1|q5
		       q5|q2|q3
q0=q0
F = {q4}

NFA - Nondeterministic finite automata
	After a transition there can be multiple states
