Oxygen and Nitrogen are the computers always logged into Ubuntu

**These will be on the midterm**

Environment Properties

Fully vs partially observable
Deterministic vs stochastic
	You know everything vs not knowing everything
Episodic vs sequential
Discrete vs continous
Static vs dynamic
Single vs multiple agent
known vs unknown
**These will be on the Midterm **

Your base starts at 0,0,0
You receive X_LOC, Y_LOC, and Z_LOC which is your current location
percept->GetAtom("X_LOC").GetValue();

plain No damage
mud   Takes extra energy
rocks Takes damage
cliff Dies
wall  Can't move

Reading Percepts

BASE = key
3 = value

CELL_132: x,y,z,N,S,E,W

ss.ignore() = Skip one char
Create a const double EPSILON = 0.0001;
include cmath for fabs(x-y) < EPSILON

Search follow this pattern
